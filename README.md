# vueReactiveDnD

Experiment to create a drag and drop mechanism similar to [DnD-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit/) (DnD-kit is for react, though)

**Try it**

Just clone the repo and run a http server (e.g. python’s `python -m http.server 8080`) in the folder. There is no webpack, npm etc. needed. 

**Structure:**

* _app.js_: sets up components in template, passes ids as props, sets onDragEnd function (which gives you the debug message at the botton of the screen and on console)
* _draggable.js_:
   * registers DOM element and Id as draggable, 
   * Sets itself as selected on mousedown (gets functions for this via inject from dragContext)
   * moves via transform:translate when selected and drag is ongoing (gets coordinates for this via inject from dragContext)
* _droppable.js_: 
   * registers DOM element and Id as droppable (gets functions for this via inject from dragContext)
* _simpleRect.js_:  does nothing, only template
* _dragContext.js_: most stuff happens here
   * Provides selection and setter for itself
   * Provides list of droppable elements 
   * Provides list of draggable elements
   * provides isDragging boolean and the difference between mousedown (dragstart) and current mouse position (as long as the drag is ongoing) 
   * calls the DragEnd event handler (if provided via prop in the app.js) 

The rest are functions imported in the components – makeDraggable and makeDroppable provide most of the non-template/event related setup for their respective components, collisionHelpers find the element the currently selected element was dropped on. It currently only uses the "whereIsRectContained" strategy. dragUtils has compute functions to be used in dragContext.js’s setup to provide some helpful reactive data about the drag.
